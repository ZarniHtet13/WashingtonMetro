### Fare Evasion Exploration

#### Problem Statement
The Washington Metro loses substantial amount of revenue each year to fare evaders (people who hop on bus without paying anything).

#### Objective
Our goal is to use existing administrative data along with American Community Survey data at the census block level to find a narrative on where the most fare evasion is happening and what could be the cause of it.

#### Team
The lead P.I of the team is [Vicki Lancaster](https://www.bi.vt.edu/faculty/Vicki-Lancaster). Lata Kodali, a Ph.D. student in Statistics at Virginia Tech and I co-led a team of 4 undergraduate interns from Virginia Tech for this project.
