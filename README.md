### Fare Evasion Exploration

#### Problem Statement
The Washington Metro loses substantial amount of revenue each year to fare evaders (people who hop on bus without paying anything).

#### Objective
Our goal is to use existing administrative data along with American Community Survey data at the census block level to find a narrative on where the most fare evasion is happening and what could be the cause of it.

#### Team
The lead P.I of the team is [Vicki Lancaster](https://www.bi.vt.edu/faculty/Vicki-Lancaster). Lata Kodali, a Ph.D. student in Statistics at Virginia Tech and I co-led a team of 4 undergraduate interns from Virginia Tech for this project.

#### Datasets
*This repository is not for reproducibility. It is to highlight some of the work I have done via some code snippets. The datasets are under strict confidentiality agreement*

Some of the datasets used in the project are as below:
1. Bus Stops (10,988 observations): bus stopID, latitude and longitude.
2. Approximate Person Counter (3,793,655 observations): front & back door entries and exits for a bus, route, trip and bus stop.
3. Farebox (2,729,688 observations): fare evasion key presses, cash and smart transaction by bus, trip and bus stop.

#### Some of my contributions to the project

1. Mentoring undergraduate students in R programming
2. Creating data dictionaries
3. Data cleaning: standardizing time, pulling in GTFS data for joining tables, writing scaffold code for undergradutes to do data exploration
4. Data generation: creating synthetic tripID (code snippet in this repo)
5.
